The [parquet-format](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format) project contains format specifications and Thrift definitions of metadata required to properly read Parquet files.

The [parquet-java](https://github.com/apache/parquet-java) project is a Java library to read and write Parquet files. It consists of multiple sub-modules, which implement the core components of reading and writing a nested, column-oriented data stream, to and from the Parquet format, along with Hadoop Input/Output Formats, Pig loaders, and other Java-based utilities for interacting with Parquet.

The [parquet-cpp](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/parquet.html) project is a C++ library to read-write Parquet files. It is part of the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) C++ implementation, with bindings to Python, R, Ruby and C/GLib.

The [parquet-rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/main/parquet) project is a Rust library to read-write Parquet files.

The [parquet-go](https://github.com/apache/arrow-go/tree/main/parquet) project is a Golang library to read-write Parquet files. It is part of the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) Go implementation.

The [parquet-compatibility](https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-compatibility) project (deprecated) contains compatibility tests that can be used to verify that implementations in different languages can read and write each otherâ€™s files. As of January 2022 compatibility tests only exist up to version 1.2.0.
